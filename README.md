# 🕵️ Secret Notes Encryptor

A simple **Tkinter-based Python app** that lets you **write, encrypt, and decrypt secret notes** using a custom master key.  
All encrypted notes are stored locally in a text file — safe and simple!

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Encrypt your notes** with a custom master key  
- 🔓 **Decrypt messages** instantly with the same key  
- 💾 **Saves encrypted notes** to a local `Notes.txt` file  
- 🧠 **Easy-to-use GUI** built with Tkinter  
- 🖼️ Optional image banner (replace `Secret.png` with your own)

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Enter your **note title**
2. Type your **secret message**
3. Choose a **master key** (used for both encryption and decryption)
4. Click **"Save & Encrypt"** to store the encrypted note in `Notes.txt`
5. To **decrypt**, paste the encrypted message into the text box, enter your master key, and click **"Decrypt"**

> ⚠️ Make sure to remember your master key — without it, your message cannot be decrypted!
